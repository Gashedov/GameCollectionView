This is a code example of a multi-section CollectionView with a custom CollectionViewLayout created to display items in back-and-forth order.

* The elements represent different types of game levels (or learning path).

* The collection fills the last line with elements with pictures if the number of elements is not a even of the number of elements in the line.

* Each section has its own design and filler images.
